        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Varenyky (pronounced vah-rEH-nee-key) are Ukrainian stuffed dumplings. Potato-filled varenyky are the most traditional and they’re one of the simplest recipes I know. They call for just a handful of ingredients that everyone, no matter how limited in means, has access to: an egg, flour, potatoes, and onions. </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>      
        <h4>Dough</h4>  
        <ul>
            <li>5 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
            <li>1 cup evaporated milk</li>
            <li>½ cup water</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Filling</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>6 medium potatoes, cut into small cubes</li>
            <li>2 large onions, finely chopped</li>
            <li>½ cup butter</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To make the dough, combine the flour and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and add the soft butter and evaporated milk; stir gently until all the liquid is absorbed. Add water only as needed, kneading continuously until dough sticks together. Place dough into a greased bowl, turn to coat, and let rest for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>To make the potato filling, place potatoes into a saucepan with water to cover. Bring to a boil and cook until tender, about 10 minutes. Drain and set aside. Melt 1/2 cup butter in a medium skillet, over medium heat. Saute onions in butter until tender. Mix the onions into the potatoes along with the cheese and season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Remove the dough from the bowl onto a lightly floured surface. Roll out to 1/8 inch in thickness. Cut into 3 inch circles. Place one tablespoon of filling onto one side of the circle. Fold the other half over and press the edges to seal. Place finished dumplings onto a floured tray and keep covered.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Drop 10 or so dumplings into the water at a time. Cook for 3 to 5 minutes, then remove to a colander to drain. Place finished dumplings onto a lightly oiled dish and turn them to coat with a thin layer. This will keep them from sticking together. Serve dumplings with fried onions and sour cream. Cooled dumplings also can be fried in oil and butter for a nice crispy surface.</li>
